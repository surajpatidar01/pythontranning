'''Practice Question:
As you surely know, due to some astronomical reasons, years may be leap or common. The former are 366 days long, while the latter are 365 days long.
Since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar (in 1582), the following rule is used to determine the kind of year:
if the year number isn't divisible by four, it's a common year;
otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 100, it's a leap year;
otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 400, it's a common year;
otherwise, it's a leap year.
Look at the code in the editor – it only reads a year number, and needs to be completed with the instructions implementing the test we've just described.
The code should output one of two possible messages, which are Leap year or Common year, depending on the value entered.
It would be good to verify if the entered year falls into the Gregorian era, and output a warning otherwise: Not within the Gregorian calendar period.'''

'''Listen to this story: a boy and his father, a computer programmer, are playing with wooden blocks. They are
building a pyramid.
Their pyramid is a bit weird, as it is actually a pyramid-shaped wall – it's flat. The pyramid is stacked according
to one simple principle: each lower layer contains one block more than the layer above.
The figure illustrates the rule used by the builders:
Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks
the builders have, and outputs the height of the pyramid that can
be built using these blocks.
Note: the height is measured by the number of fully completed layers –
if the builders don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot
complete the next layer, they finish their work immediately.'''

'''In 1937, a German mathematician named Lothar Collatz formulated an intriguing hypothesis (it still remains
unproven) which can be described in the following way:
1. take any non-negative and non-zero integer number and name it c0;
2. if it's even, evaluate a new c0 as c0 ÷ 2;
3. otherwise, if it's odd, evaluate a new c0 as 3 × c0 + 1;
4. if c0 ≠ 1, go back to point 2.
The hypothesis says that regardless of the initial value of c0, it will always go to 1.
Of course, it's an extremely complex task to use a computer in order to prove the hypothesis for any natural
number (it may even require artificial intelligence), but you can use Python to check some individual numbers.
Maybe you'll even find the one which would disprove the hypothesis.
Write a program which reads one natural number and executes the above steps as long as c0 remains different
from 1. We also want you to count the steps needed to achieve the goal. Your code should output all the
intermediate values of c0, too.
Hint: the most important part of the problem is how to transform Collatz's idea into a while loop – this is the
key to success.'''
